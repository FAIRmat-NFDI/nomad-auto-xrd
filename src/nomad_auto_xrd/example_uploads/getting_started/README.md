# XRD auto analyzer with NOMAD

This example upload will teach you how you can train a model
of [XRD-AutoAnalyzer](https://github.com/njszym/XRD-AutoAnalyzer) in NOMAD and archive it to find it, share it and using it easily for analyzing your XRD patterns automatically.

Firstly, you will find a folder in this upload called **All_CIFs**. This containes all structure files that one can include to train the model for given chemical space. The model then will learn to identify if any of these structures can be asigned in your pattern.

Follow along the notebook to get started with the current CIF files provided or feel free to add the ones you want.

- Click on the **FILES** tab and open `auto-xrd-train.ipynb`.
- Launch notebook in *jupyter*. If jupyter is already running, please press stop and start a new one.
- Follow the notebook for the rest of the tutorial.
